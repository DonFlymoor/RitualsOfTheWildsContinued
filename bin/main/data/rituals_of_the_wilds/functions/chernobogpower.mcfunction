tellraw @s "<Chernobog> Power is never forbidden. Only unpriced. There is no sin in corruption â€” only transformation. Fire does not ask if it may burn. Neither do I.  Accept this: nothing remains pure when it grows. Roots rot. Flesh cracks. Mind fractures. But what survives... is sharpened. Tempered in suffering.  I will give you power. Not clean. Not safe. But yours. And through it, you will understand why purity is weakness."
